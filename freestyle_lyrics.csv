My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don't know what really happened, I think he home invaded a nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a niggaWhy the fuck would I chase a bitch when I don't even chase the liquor
Hell yeah, they call me Kodak, but I ain't come to take no pictures
So icy make it blizzard and I'm leaning sipping sizzurpLil Wiz still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
I was texting and driving, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Why they say, boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I'mma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, cause momma soon I hit her I'm a quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I'm smokin' purp, thinking 'bout chief the purp
Rest in peace, wayne hit a perc, new boy down to earthShe know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with that paper, yeah I got that work","2016"

Talkin' bout these fake ass niggas that hide behind the AVI graphics
Girls wanna be plastic, even though they beautiful the way they are
Get it through they heads, now they strippin' on the Worldstar
This ain't Hip Hop, buddy, I'mma need more chicks
More clips, fuck a big body Benz, I need warships
2014, I went through the worst shit
A near death experience helped me thinkin' 'bout torment
Fuck friends, they just run they courses
Now these niggas faker than animes that they worship
Smile in your face, but on the real I know it's horse shit
Let the dork live, but God said ""let the Lord spit""I'm the king of the mischievous south
And this one goes to all the hoes that be screaming it outBlack hawks flying around my city, that's my vicinity
But I don't give a fuck, none of that shit really interest me

You wanted a show? Just open your eyes
This is life as you know it
A few make it through, most won't survive
A penny with a hole with no hope inside
It's survival of the finesse
And my nigga's went to dinners
So we taking a bite
And I made up my mind
The whole world loves you when you're top of the line

Venting her troubles and getting her truffles

And someone tell him, “Listen, you buggin’
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble?”, but he rebuttal with
“I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought of being anything other than nice”

Want to see me dead or broke, I know I need that motivation
Like if I blow my shot, lose everything I got
Have my hand out on that block, become everything I’m not
Been through that life, I blew that check, lost everything I had
That shit just left me looking silly and my mama sad
No nigga ever gave me shit when I was down bad
I was by myself in a six foot room right there on my ass
And now I stack that shit and mean it, like I’m on my last
I stay so low from fuck niggas like they on my ass

Got to stay lowkey but I can’t wait to let ‘em feel my wrath

Never knew what we all headed out for
Young niggas having real life shootouts
By my grandma house, had to move out
Started rapping, wasn’t tryna be a star
I was speaking what I lived, what I knew ‘bout
17 had labels tryna sign me
Thought might as well speak, so I flew out
Flew back, had to see what I was worth
Hit the studio, I know what I’ma do now
Meanwhile tryna make it in a warzone
Matter fact, let me hold that thoughtMy city know I ain’t even got to talk
Pull up, hop out, white chalk
Now you see me, smell money when I walk
Humble with it, no I ain’t tryna floss
Every real street nigga took a loss
Took a few, bounced back, shook it off
Had an X by my name, took it off

Three baby daddies, two of 'em got killed
The other one was a deadbeat
Might as well say that nigga got killed
Growin' up without a dad
Always had it bad, we was in and out of shelters
Crazy how we had family all around the world
And really, ain't nobody really help us

I remember feelin' helpless
Swear, I wish I could fucking catch him
Swear, man, I would fuckin' wet him
Yeah, shit, uh
Man, it's crazy how the times change

And lately I've been thinkin' 'bout the bigger picture

When he got killed that night I wish that I was with that nigga
Swear, I wish heaven was like jail when I could visit niggas
Speakin' of visits, I'm screaming ""free Shotty""
Can't even lie, I need the go see Shotty

Think about this shit in a couple months
Leave it up to me and we all gon' be livin' different
I'm talkin' big houses, big cars, and big business
I'm tryna put my niggas in the good position
I'm tryna pay Milan whole school tuition

[Verse]No weapon formed against me shall prosperMy sword look just like Michael'sHe lent it to me, this a house of GodI'm just leasing, he rent it to meThis sentence he penned it tooThat's a Gmail, he sent it to meI can send you his contact, hit him if you in combatHit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no staticThat's my G, he got me shinin'My hair, he made it tangledMy seed, don't need no liningA halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rapFinally give the city back, and ask God for a piggy-backUp on his shoulders I notice, I'm within earshotI yell, ""Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris""","2014"

I like to get my dick sucked while I'm getting high
Make her deep throat, her mouth never get dry
I say ""Who pussy is this?"", She say ""Dolla $ign""
Whose pussy is this? She say ""Dolla $ign""
She strippin' still got nine to five
Say that she's mine but that's a lie
These hoes will tell you anything
She want the money and the fame
South Central niggas really don't be loving these hoes
These hoes don't be loving these niggas
Really, we all just want the money
Money, money baby, baby, Pusha Ink baby
Said she got blunts, I said ""I only smoke papers""

Something that I got to tell somebody
Just in case you didn't knowI got to show you where I came from
So you can see where I gotta go
I started up with nothing
And I've been through some things
But there really ain't a difference
Not that I got a little changeI've been hood rich, and I've been brokeSinging in the choir y'all, even sold dopeI done been clean, and I've been high
Lived like a king and I had to get by
Had a couple tears in my bed at one time
Some down bitches when I didn't have a dime
